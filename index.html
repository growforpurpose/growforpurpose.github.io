								Our purpose – to help local communities. 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								How – by donating 10% of each sale to local organisations.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								We are a local Tasmanian social enterprise business wanting to help local communities in Southern Tasmania.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								We do this by donating 10% of each sale to local organisations in Southern Tasmania. We have kept it simple as we believe in transparency and want to show where all money has been donated.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								Our first product is dried Tasmanian <a href="#pepperberries">Pepperberries</a> to Pepperberries page>. We have deliberately not placed a sticky label on the jars so that they can be easily reused, recycled or returned to us to reuse. You can find more information on this on our <a href="./index.html">home</a> page.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								Further products we are working on – 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								<b>Plants:</b> established succulents, indoor plants and Tasmanian natives such as the Waratah, Pepperberry, Blue & other Gums, Blackwood & Celery Top Pine. Propagated and grown in the Huon Valley using only rainwater and natural compost/fertilisers. All of our pots have been sourced locally and second hand to reuse with our plants. We are always on the lookout for ceramic style pots in good or at least reasonable condition so if you would like to sell/donate, please get in touch. For donated ceramic style pots, we will donate 15% of the sale price to local community organisations. 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								<b>Wood:</b> coasters (Chestnut, Sassafras, Gum/Tas Oak) and side tables (Gum/Tas Oak).
							</p>
				
							<p>
								We will be selling our products at markets around Tasmania and online through our social channels. 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								<b>Huon in a Hamper</b> is also selling our dried Tasmanian Pepperberries as a part of their <b>Spice Hamper</b>.

								<h2>Pepperberries</h2>
								<p>Tasmanian Pepperberries (Tasmannia lanceolata) and otherwise referred to as Mountain or Bush Pepper. They are packed full of antioxidants and other herbal properties including anti inflammatory, food preservation, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.</p>

								Endemic to Tasmania, Victoria & New South Wales highlands, these are natively grown in the Huon Valley, harvested by hand and naturally dried. 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								We ensure we share some with the local Currawongs who enjoy a feed on these beautiful native berries! Often a sign they are ripe to pick...
							</p>
				
							<p>
								Our dried Tasmanian Pepperberries come in 35g glass jars, we believe this is a perfect size for those new to using them. We have deliberately not placed a sticky label on the jars so that they can be easily reused, recycled or returned to us to reuse. YES that’s right, we would love to try and have any unwanted jars returned to us so that we can reuse them! Please drop off if we are at a local market near you or we can meet you in the local Huon Valley, Kingston and Hobart areas. Please get in touch to see if we can find a time to collect.

								Easiest way to use Is to think.. pepper addition or substitute. Place into a pepper grinder (you may need to crush a little bit first depending on your grinder) and use with or instead of normal black pepper. We suggest using small amounts first and add more to your taste liking. We like to crack it over peanut butter (Eumarah organic machine) on toast (Summer Kitchen sprouted sour dough) for breakfast, in ginger and lemongrass tea, on vanilla ice cream, in G & T’s (it adds a nice purple colour), in preserves (salsa, pasta sauce, relish etc…), on meat/tofu/veg, in stew, soups, mash and anywhere else you would use normal black pepper.
