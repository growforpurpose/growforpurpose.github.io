								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>
									<b>Our purpose</b> – to help local communities <br><br>
									<b>How</b> – by donating 10% of each sale to local organisations
								</p>
							</header>
				
							<p>
								We are a local Tasmanian social enterprise business wanting to do our part by helping local communities in Southern Tasmania.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								We do this by donating 10% of each sale to local organisations in Southern Tasmania. We have kept it simple as we believe in transparency and want to show where all money has been donated.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								Our first product is dried Tasmanian <a href="#pepperberries">Pepperberries</a>. We have deliberately not placed a sticky label on the jars so that they can be easily reused, recycled or returned to us to reuse. You can find more information about this on our <a href="#">home</a> page.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								Further products we are working on – 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								<b>Plants:</b> established succulents, indoor plants and Tasmanian natives such as the Waratah, Pepperberry, Blue & other Gums, Blackwood & Celery Top Pine. Propagated and grown in the Huon Valley using only rainwater and natural compost/fertilisers. All of our pots have been sourced locally and second hand to reuse with our plants. We are always on the lookout for ceramic style pots in good or at least reasonable condition so if you would like to sell/donate, please get in touch. For donated ceramic style pots, we will donate 15% of the sale price to local community organisations. 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								<b>Wood:</b> coasters (Chestnut, Sassafras, Gum/Tas Oak) and side tables (Gum/Tas Oak).
							</p>
				
							<p>
								We will be selling our products at markets around Tasmania and online through our social channels. 
							</p>
				
							<p>
								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/huoninahamper">Huon in a Hamper</a> is also selling our dried Tasmanian Pepperberries as a part of their <b>Spice Hamper</b>.
